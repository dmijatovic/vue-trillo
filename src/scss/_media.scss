/**
  MEDIA QUERIES remarks
  in media queries rem are not based on root font user defines
  in some browsers functionality does not works properly (according to Jonas)
  advised approach for expressing different screen sizes in media queries
  is to use em and static default font-size of 16px. This approach will take
  into account users that changed default fonts from 16 to larger/smaller.

  So to define breakpoints in your media query follow this process
  define breakpoints in px. Then divide breakpoint px / 16. This 
  you em media query value to use.

//sizes xs, sm, md use min-width and xl uses max-width

//multiple sizes, for example: if you want specific style for 
//md, sm and xs then you just can use md and other will fall 
//in the same category
